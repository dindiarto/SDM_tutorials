##Chapter 1 Introduction

Synonyms: Climate modelling envelope, habitat modelling, and niche-modeling.

Main Aim: to estimate the similarity of the condition at any site to the conditions at any sites to the conditions at the locations of known occurence of a phenomenon.

##### Major steps in SDMs:

1. a compilation of species occurence locations
2. values of environmental predictor variables (such as climate), extracted from climate databases
3. model fitting
4. prediction of variable of interest across an the region of interest
